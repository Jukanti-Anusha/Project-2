HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION BASED HEAD CONTROLLED MOUSE

Problem Statement:
Individuals with mobility impairments often face significant challenges in using traditional computer interfaces, which rely heavily on hand-operated devices like mouse and keyboards. This limits their ability to access digital information, perform everyday tasks, and participate in professional and educational activities. There is a critical need for an alternative input method that allows hands-free control of the computer, providing these individuals with greater independence and accessibility. Developing a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system that utilizes head movements to control the mouse cursor addresses this need, offering a more inclusive solution for users with limited hand mobility.
